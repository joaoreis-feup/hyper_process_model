# Hyper Process Model


This repository contains the full implementation of the algorithm Hyper-Process Model (HPM) using as example a set of curves from Beta Distribution. This algorithm is used in the conference publication: 

"Reis, J., Gon√ßalves, G., & Link, N. (2017, October). Meta-process modeling methodology for process model generation in intelligent manufacturing. In Industrial Electronics Society, IECON 2017-43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE (pp. 3396-3402). IEEE."

where a private dataset from an industrial company is used. In the referred publication, the algorithm is not framed into a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) problem, and more specifically in the regression setting for ZSL.
