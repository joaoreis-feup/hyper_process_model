# Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) - Hyper-Process Model


This repository contains the full implementation of the algorithm Hyper-Process Model (HPM) using as example a set of curves from Beta Distribution. Contrary to all the available and most known algorithms for ZSL, this algorithm was specifically designed for regression problems and not classification, which, up-to-now, makes this algorithm unique. 

This algorithm is used in the following publications:

# How to run the algorithm?

In the beginning of the code, there's a variable "HPM = True" that defines if the algorithm used is the HPM or Hyper-Model according to the the following publication:

"Jürgen Pollak and Norbert Link. From models to hyper-models of physical objects and industrial processes. In Electronics and Telecommunications (ISETC), 2016 12th IEEE International Symposium on, pages 317–320. IEEE, 2016."

"Jürgen Pollak, Alireza Sarveniazi, and Norbert Link. Retrieval of process methods from task descriptions and generalized data representations. The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 53(5-8):829–840, 2011."

The program writes all the results in a .txt file where a set of hyperparameters are tested. For the HPM, these hyperparameters are the Number of Components used in the decomposition of shapes (SSM) and the polynomial degree for the hyper-model training. As for the Hyper-Model alone (not framed in the HPM), these hyperparameters are the polynomial degree to train all source models and the polynomial degree for the hyper-model training. For this case, 25 different functions where generated based on all combinations between a and b values of 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 15. These set of values were chosen because they generate a set of 4 different types of functions. The goal for this example is to predict curves outside the 25 functions generated by the presented a and b values. Therefore, in the training phase only the curves generated by the 25 set of Beta Distribution parameters will be used, where in the test phase 16 different combinations of a and b parameters will be used in HPM algorithm to generate the corresponding curves. Here, the task descriptions will be the a and b parameters to train the hyper-model. The set of values for a and b parameters in the test phase are 4, 6, 8 and 12. In order to generate the curves, 20 input values between 0.01 and 0.99 were used to ensure a fair representation of each curve.
